title: SK digital garden
---

This site is is based on a 'second brain' or [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought)' using the free tool, Quartz. 

This site is being used as an experimental approach to an interdisciplinary research project....more info to come :-). 

My thanks to Jacky Zhao for the fantastic work in creating and sharing the Quartz tool. Most of the current content is based on the template material. 

The 'new' content currently developed can be navigated from [scenarios]
