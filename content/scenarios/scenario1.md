> [!FAQ] Scenario: 
> [[scenarios/stakeholders/laypublic|You]] have a health issue. [[scenarios/stakeholders/laypublic|Two trusted friends]] have [[scenarios/resourcesIn/infoseeking|found information]] from [[scenarios/stakeholders/scicomms|genuine experts]], but the advice apparently conflicts. You’ve seen some [[scenarios/stakeholders/media|media]] coverage of this, and found [[scenarios/stakeholders/social media|social media]] discussion too. Your [[scenarios/stakeholders/doctor|doctors]] has been supportive, but reluctant to give strong advice. They’ve provided you with a [[scenarios/resourcesIn/decision tool|decision tool]] to help you choose, but the tool doesn’t explain why the [[scenarios/concepts/NoS|experts disagree]] and now [[scenarios/concepts/epistemic cognition|you’re wondering]] if the expert knowledge is even helpful if they can’t decide. You know '[[scenarios/concepts/statsliteracy|stats literacy]] can be an issue, and that the media has a '[[scenarios/concepts/medialiteracy|conflict sells]]' approach.
